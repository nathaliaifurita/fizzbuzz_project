# FizzbuzzProject

The FizzBuzz Project is a project that I've made following the course: [Elixir e Phoenix do zero! Crie sua primeira API Phoenix.](https://www.udemy.com/course/elixir-e-phoenix-do-zero/)

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `fizzbuzz_project` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:fizzbuzz_project, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```


## To Execute the project:

1. ``` iex -S mix ````
2. ```FizzbuzzProject.build("number.txt")```



Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/fizzbuzz_project>.
